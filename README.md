For teleporting between dimensions (overworld and warden dimension), you just need to make or use the portals in ancient cities.
Just use a flint n steel and light up the portal. It's that simple.
The plugin will take care of everything.

#Commands
/generate <world name> - This will generate a new warden dimension
